## Description and About
This is an open source website to help users find monitor prices easily in India. Me and my friends struggled to get a good deal for a monitor as there is only so much you can look for online at one place. The website uses firebase to host and uses firebase realtime db to store all the data. Note that we try to keep on adding as much data as we can. 

The public folder contains all the files for the website. The index.html is the main UI and the firebase configuration is inside the getmonitordata.js.
